# Trox's Editor Configs

This is my repo for collecting alternative vim and emacs editor configurations.

## Why a collection of configurations?

I struggle a bit with editor configs. Since I began working at Meta, I use our
internal VSCode for most of my daily work, so I've gotten out of practice dealing with
vim and emacs. And the vim / emacs world has changed significantly with the widespread
adoption of LSP, so my older configs are not really sensible anymore.

Given this state of affairs, I want to make it easy to switch between configs, and in
particular have some very simple configs that are easy for me to read in one go when I
need to remember how things work as well as some bigger "starter-kit" based configs.

## What is here?

- `trox-nvim-starter`: My fork of the excelent `nvim-starter` repo: a very simple config
  but with basic LSP support wired up. This is a minimal usable config for ocaml.
